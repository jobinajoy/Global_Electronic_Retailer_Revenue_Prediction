# Global Electronic Retailer Revenue Prediction


## Saved_Models

This repository contains the saved machine learning models:  
     1 Linear Regression model
     2 Ridge Regression model
     3 Lasso Regression model
     4 ElasticNet Regression model
     
The goal is to predict the total revenue generated by the sale of electronic product in a specific quantity, color, model and purchase year.

## Model 
The 4 models utilizes the below features.

        'Product Name'- Electronic product name 
        'Category' - Category it is belonging
        'Quantity' - Number of quantity sold or ordered
        'Order Year' - Year on which product is sold
        'Color' - Color of the product
        'Unit Cost USD' 
        'Unit Price USD'
        'Brand'

The target variable is the Total Revenue.

The model is built using the following pipeline:

    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
    Model Training: Using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression, RidgeRegression, LassoRegression, ElasticNetRegression class.
    Evaluation: Metrics such as RMSE and R^2 Score are used to evaluate the model's performance.
